10 ESLint rules behave differently from their TSLint counterparts:
  * @typescript-eslint/quotes:
    - Option "jsx-double" is not supported by ESLint.
  * no-underscore-dangle:
    - Leading or trailing underscores (_) on identifiers will now be forbidden.
  * import/no-extraneous-dependencies:
    - ESLint does not support whitelisting modules
  * no-invalid-this:
    - Functions in methods will no longer be ignored.
  * @typescript-eslint/no-unused-expressions:
    - The TSLint optional config "allow-new" is the default ESLint behavior and will no longer be ignored.
  * prefer-arrow/prefer-arrow-functions:
    - ESLint does not support allowing standalone function declarations.
    - ESLint does not support allowing named functions defined with the function keyword.
  * eqeqeq:
    - Option "smart" allows for comparing two literal values, evaluating the value of typeof and null comparisons.
  * no-redeclare:
    - ESLint does not support check-parameters.
  * react/jsx-no-bind:
    - ESLint rule 'jsx-no-bind' also checks for arrow functions
    - ESLint rule 'jsx-no-bind' also checks for Function.bind
  * padded-blocks:
    - ESLint's padded-blocks rule also bans a blank line before a closing brace.

Error: multiple output react/jsx-curly-spacing ESLint rule options were generated, but tslint-to-eslint-config doesn't have "merger" logic to deal with this.
